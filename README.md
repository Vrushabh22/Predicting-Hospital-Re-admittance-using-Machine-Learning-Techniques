# Predicting-Hospital-Re-admittance-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

In this project, we utilized the UCI dataset known as the "diabetic_data.csv." This dataset encompasses a span of 10 years (1999-2008) and encompasses clinical care data from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
Comprising 50 explanatory variables, the dataset provides insights into both patient and hospital outcomes. Our primary objective is to predict the readmission likelihood of patients discharged from hospitals within a 30-day timeframe, leveraging the information within the dataset. Prior to analysis, the data has undergone preprocessing procedures and has been partitioned into separate training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.


# Dataset Information
The data originates from the  UCI Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Diabetes 130-US hospitals for the years 1999-2008 Data Set (Beata, 2014, p. 2). This dataset comprises a total of 101,766 records and encompasses 50 attributes. Each record in the ‘diabetic_data.csv’ file describes a unique patient’s earliest admission at a participating health institution as recorded by their electronic medical record. The dataset  is split into a train and test data set for training and testing purposes. The input data consisted of two CSV files:

- diabetic_data_test.csv
- diabetic_data_train.csv

# Information about files

- diabetic_data.csv: Combined dataset.
- diabetic_data_train.csv: Training dataset.
- diabetic_data_test.csv: Testing dataset.
- main.ipynb: Contains all the functions, models, and results from the project.
- IDs_mapping.csv: Contains the IDs and their descriptions for the admission type, discharge disposition, and admission source.
- Report.pdf: Report of the project.

# How to Run the project

To maintain simplicity, I have consolidated all components within a single Python Notebook file. By navigating through the Notebook, each cell contains comprehensive comments which will help understand the project steps.
