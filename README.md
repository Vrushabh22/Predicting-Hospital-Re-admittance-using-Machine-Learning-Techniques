# Predicting-Hospital-Re-admittance-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

In this project, we utilized the UCI dataset known as the "diabetic_data.csv." This dataset encompasses a span of 10 years (1999-2008) and encompasses clinical care data from 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
Comprising 50 explanatory variables, the dataset provides insights into both patient and hospital outcomes. Our primary objective is to predict the readmission likelihood of patients discharged from hospitals within a 30-day timeframe, leveraging the information within the dataset. Prior to analysis, the data has undergone preprocessing procedures and has been partitioned into separate training and testing sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.
